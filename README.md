# Melanoma Detection App

## Overview
This Melanoma Detection App is an interactive web application designed to assist in the detection and understanding of melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. The app utilizes advanced deep learning models to analyze skin and dermoscopy images, providing educational resources and visualizations to enhance understanding of melanoma.

## Website
The application is deployed and accessible at: [Melanoma Detection App Â· Streamlit](https://melanoma-detection.streamlit.app/)

## Features
- **Multiple Model Support**: Includes various deep learning models (CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNetB4, InceptionResNetV2) for both skin and dermoscopy image analysis.
- **Interactive Image Upload**: Users can upload their own skin or dermoscopy images for analysis.
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Displays detailed performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC for each model.
- **Visualizations**: Offers interactive data visualizations to understand the distribution of melanoma cases, age, and gender in the dataset.
- **Educational Resources**: Provides curated links to academic articles, websites, and research papers on melanoma and related technologies.
- **FAQs Section**: Answers common questions about the app and melanoma detection.
- **Feedback System**: Includes a form for users to submit feedback or questions.
